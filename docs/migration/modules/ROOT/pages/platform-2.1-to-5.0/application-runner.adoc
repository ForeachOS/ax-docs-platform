= Across application runner

Across now has an `AcrossApplicationRunner` which can be used instead of a regular `SpringApplication`.
It uses a custom `BeanFactory` for the root `ApplicationContext`, directly supporting exposed beans.
This removes some overhead and can have a minor performance gain.

The custom `AcrossApplicationRunner` is a drop-in replacement for `SpringApplication`.
An equivalent `AcrossApplicationRunnerBuilder` and `AcrossApplicationServletInitializer` is also available.

When upgrading, the following can be done:

* `SpringApplication.run()` can be replaced with `AcrossApplicationRunner.run()`
* `new SpringApplication()` can be replaced with `new AcrossApplicationRunner()`
* `extends SpringBootServletInitializer` can be replaced with `extends AcrossApplicationServletInitializer`
* `SpringApplicationBuilder` can be replaced with `AcrossApplicationRunnerBuilder`
