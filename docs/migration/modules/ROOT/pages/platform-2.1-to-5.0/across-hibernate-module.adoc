= Across Hibernate Module changes

== BasicRepository interceptor

Since `BasicRepository` is `@Deprecated` and shouldn't be used anymore,
we have disabled the default registration of the `BasicRepositoryInterceptor`.

The default behaviour is now:

`across-hibernate.register-repository-interceptor=false`.

If you still use interceptors on `BasicRepository` it is strongly recommend to switch to JPA repositories.
As an alternative you can rever to the old behaviour by setting the property to `across-hibernate.register-repository-interceptor=true`.

The behaviour for `JpaRepositoryInterceptor` remains unchanged.
