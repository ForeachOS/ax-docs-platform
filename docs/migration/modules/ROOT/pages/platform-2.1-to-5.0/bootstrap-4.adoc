== Bootstrap 4

We upgraded from bootstrap 3 to bootstrap 4 in BootstrapUiModule.

The following classes where removed in favor of using the new bootstrap 4 factory `BootstrapViewElements`.

* BootstrapUiFactory & BootstrapUiFactoryImpl
* BootstrapUiComponentFactory & BootstrapUiComponentFactoryImpl
* BootstrapUiBuildersBroken

=== BootstrapViewElements
The `BootstrapViewElements` class has become the main entry point for creating `ViewElement` and `ViewElementBuilders`.

ViewElements can be created using: `BootstrapViewElements.bootstrap`

ViewElementBuilders can be created using: `BootstrapViewElements.bootstrap.builders`
